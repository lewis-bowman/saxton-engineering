Saxton Engineering Services Limited

A company started by a friend around the same time that I started learning to
code. I asked if I could create a website for his company (pro bono) and
he agreed (smart).

The company is an engineering services provider based primarily in South 
Yorkshire. The client felt that a website would help increase his profile and
potentially bring in work for him. Due to the nature of his work, this would
involve an easy to interact with contact section, and space for any queries
potential customers may have. 

The client is also keen to build up a good reputation for his work, so a 
references section may be of use, however, as it is early days, it is not a 
necessity. 

The website will be a fairly simple linear design. I have chosen to use
bootstrap due to the professional and modern appearance, and it's simplicity
at this early stage in my career.

The client will be involved in the design process quite closely, as he is keen 
to have close involvement with his branding and image.
